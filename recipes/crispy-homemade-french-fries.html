  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This next potato recipe, Crispy Homemade French Fries, is number 2 on the list of the potato recipes that I plan to
    do with the 10 lb of Idaho potatoes that I got a few days ago. I like French fries but I prefer them crunchy.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>7 pieces baking potatoes</li>
    <li>A dash of salt</li>
    <li>4 cups cooking oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Peel the potatoes. Use a vegetable peeler to save time.</li>
    <li>Slice the potatoes into long thin pieces.</li>
    <li>Soak the potatoes in ice water for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain the water and dry the potatoes using a paper towel.</li>
    <li>Deep fry the potatoes for 10 minutes or until the color turns light brown. Do not put too many potatoes in a
      batch as it will take more time for it to be cooked.</li>
    <li>Remove the potatoes from the deep fryer or cooking pot and allow to cool for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Put the fried potatoes back in the fryer and fry for another 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove the fried potatoes and transfer to a plate with paper towels. Sprinkle some salt to taste.</li>
    <li>Serve. Share and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
